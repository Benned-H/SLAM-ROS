# SLAM-ROS
A repository for code developed by and for UR Robotics implementing various algorithms from the Probabilistic Robotics textbook. Algorithms so far implemented:

* Velocity-based motion model for forward simulation of a differential drive robot.
* A* search for planning paths on a discrete grid.
* Pure pursuit for path-following control.
* Occupancy grid mapping using laserscan sensor data.
